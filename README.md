# Death Is Only The Beginning
## Project for The GameDev.tv Game Jam 

This project is for the Game Jam of GameDev.tv at the end of may 2022. 

## Game Idea

### Main mechanics

Your character lives only for a short time. 
That time you have to collect points.
If the time is up the character dies.
When the  character dies you are taken to a screen where you can spend the points 
	on skills for your next character. 
Also this character inherrits als the stuf you stored in a special box. 

The game is over, when you die and have less points then your previous run
